The code can be run from an IDE that supports javafx. In order to start the project, you have to run Main.java.

This project is an old-school style arcade game inspired by Star Wars.

Important Note: The code as is runs without errors. 
If you are receiving errors, make sure the images and sound files 
used by the program are accessible for your IDE.
(This should be okay for eclipse)
